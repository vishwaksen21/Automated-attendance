## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

If you see any issues:

1. **Logo image not found?** 
   - The code handles this gracefully - works without the logo

2. **Cards look different?**
   - This depends on your screen resolution (designed for 1000x650)

3. **Colors wrong?**
   - All colors are hardcoded for consistency

4. **Hover not working?**
   - This is normal on some systems - functionality still works
